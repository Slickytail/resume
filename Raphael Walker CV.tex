        \textbf{Benchmarking the Borg algorithm on the bbob-biobj testbed}\\
        \textit{GECCO '23: BBOB Workshop \hfill 2023}\\
        \textit{With D. Brockhoff, P. Capetillo, and J. Hornewall}

        The Borg MOEA is an optimization algorithm, designed to handle real-world problems of a multi objective and multimodal nature.
        We benchmark the performance of the algorithm on the bbob-biobj test suite via the COCO platform, comparing it to current state-of-the-art algorithms.
        We also develop a custom parameter tuning scheme, which substantially improves Borg's performance on the test suite without problem-specific information.

        \textit{La Matematica, Vol. 2 No. 2 \hfill 2023}\\
        \textit{With J. Crager, F. Flores, T. Goldberg, L. Rose, D. Rose-Levine, and D. Thornburgh}

        We define a cap in the affine geometry AG$(n, 2)$ to be a subset in which any collection of 4 points is in general position.
        We classify, up to affine equivalence, all caps in AG$(n, 2)$ of size at most $k \leq 9$.

        \textbf{A Small Maximal Sidon Set in $\mathbb{Z}_2^n$}\\
        \textit{Siam Journal of Discrete Mathematics, Vol. 36 No. 3 \hfill 2022}\\
        \textit{With M. Redman and L. Rose}

        A Sidon set is a subset of an Abelian group with the property that each sum of two distinct elements is distinct.
        We construct a small maximal Sidon set of size $O((n \cdot 2^n)^{1/3})$ in the group ${\mathbb{Z}}_2^n$,
        generalizing a result of Ruzsa concerning maximal Sidon sets in the integers.

        \textbf{Lagrangian Cobordisms of Legendrian Pretzel Knots with Maximal Thurston-Bennequin Number}\\
        \textit{Undergraduate Senior Thesis, Bard College \hfill 2021}\\
        \textit{With C. Leverson}

        In the study of Legendrian knots, which are smoothly embedded circles constrained by a differential geometric condition,
        an actively-studied problem is to find conditions for the existence of Lagrangian cobordisms,
        which are Lagrangian surfaces whose slices resemble specific Legendrian knots at each end.
        We demonstrate a family of knots where each has a maximal-tb representative admitting a Lagrangian cobordism from a stabilized Legendrian unknot.
